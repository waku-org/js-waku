- When using `addDecryptionKey`,
  it is now possible to specify the decryption method and the content topics of the messages to decrypt;
  this is to reduce the number of decryption attempt done and improve performance.

- Use webpack to build UMD bundle of the library, see [README](./README.md) for usage.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Renamed `WakuStore.QueryOptions`'s `direction` to `pageDirection` (and its type) as it only affects the page ordering,
  not the ordering of messages with the page.

### Fixed

- Docs: Ensure that `WakuStore`'s `QueryOptions` documentation is available [online](https://js-waku.wakuconnect.dev/).

## [0.13.1] - 2021-09-21

### Fixed

- `Error: Bootstrap requires a list of peer addresses` error when using `bootstrap: true` in `Waku.create`.

## [0.13.0] - 2021-09-16

- `Waku.waitForConnectedPeer` helper to ensure that we are connected to Waku peers when using the bootstrap option.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Buffer concat error when using symmetric encryption in the browser.

## [0.11.0] - 2021-08-20

### Added

- Examples: New [Ethereum Private Message Using Wallet Encryption Web App](./examples/eth-pm-wallet-encryption/README.md)

### Changed

- Renamed `discover.getStatusFleetNodes` to `discovery.getBootstrapNodes`;
  Changed the API to allow retrieval of bootstrap nodes from other sources.
- Examples: Renamed `eth-dm` to `eth-pm`; "Direct Message" can lead to confusion with "Direct Connection" that
  refers to low latency network connections.
- Examples (eth-pm): Use sign typed data EIP-712 instead of personal sign.
- Upgraded dependencies to remove warning at installation.
- **Breaking**: Moved `DefaultPubSubTopic` to `waku.ts` and fixed the casing.
- **Breaking**: Rename all `pubsubTopic` occurrences to `pubSubTopic`, across all interfaces.

### Removed

- Examples (cli-chat): The focus of this library is Web environment;
  Several examples now cover usage of Waku Relay and Waku Store making cli-chat example obsolete;
  web-chat POC should be preferred to use the [TOY-CHAT](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/22/) protocol.
- `ChatMessage` has been moved from js-waku to web-chat example;
  it is a type used for the [TOY-CHAT](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/22/) protocol;
  js-waku users should not build on top if this toy protocol and instead design message data structures appropriate to their use case.
- Unused dependencies & scripts.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-08-06

### Added

- Relay and ReactJS guides and examples
  ([#56](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/56)).

- `ChatMessage.payloadAsUtf8` returning garbage on utf-8 non-ascii characters.

## [0.9.0] - 2021-07-26

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Store Response Protobuf changed to align with nim-waku v0.5

## [0.8.1] - 2021-07-16

### Added

- Examples (web-chat): New `/fleet` command to switch connection between Status prod and test fleets.
- Export `generatePrivateKey` and `getPublicKey` directly from the root.

- Support multiple protocol ids for Waku Relay, allowing interoperability with nim-waku v0.4 and latest master
  ([#238](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/238)).

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Renamed `WakuRelay.(add|delete)PrivateDecryptionKey` to `WakuRelay.(add|delete)DecryptionKey` to make it clearer that it accepts both symmetric keys and asymmetric private keys.
- Upgrade libp2p to 0.32.0.
- **Breaking**: Rename `keepAlive` option to `pingKeepAlive`.
- Introduced new `relayKeepAlive` option on `Waku` with a default to 59s to send ping messages over relay to ensure the relay stream stays open.
  This is a workaround until [js-libp2p#744](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/744) is done as there are issues when TCP(?) timeouts and the stream gets closed
  ([#185](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/185), [js-libp2p#939](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/issues/939))

- Keep alive feature that pings host regularly, reducing the chance of connections being dropped due to idle.
  Can be disabled or default frequency (10s) can be changed when calling `Waku.create`.
- New `lib/utils` module for easy, dependency-less hex/bytes conversions.
- New `peers` and `randomPeer` methods on `WakuStore` and `WakuLightPush` to have a better idea of available peers;
  Note that it does not check whether Waku node is currently connected to said peers.
- Enable passing decryption private keys to `WakuStore.queryHistory`.
- Test: Introduce testing in browser environment (Chrome) using Karma.
- Add support for Waku Message version 1: Asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption, and signature of the data.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Auto select peer if none provided for store and light push protocols.
- Upgrade to `libp2p@0.31.7` and `libp2p-gossipsub@0.10.0` to avoid `TextEncoder` errors in ReactJS tests.
- Disable keep alive by default as latest nim-waku release does not support ping protocol.
- **Breaking**: Optional parameters for `WakuMessage.fromBytes` and `WakuMessage.fromUtf8String` are now passed in a single `Options` object.
- **Breaking**: `WakuMessage` static functions are now async to allow for encryption and decryption.
- **Breaking**: `WakuMessage` constructor is now private, `from*` and `decode*` function should be used.
- `WakuMessage` version 1 is partially supported, enabling asymmetrical encryption and signature of messages;
  this can be done by passing keys to `WakuMessage.from*` and `WakuMessage.decode*` methods.
- Examples (eth-dm): Use Waku Message version 1 encryption scheme instead of `eth-crypto`.
- Examples (eth-dm): Use Protobuf for direct messages instead of JSON ([#214](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/issues/214)).

### Fixed

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Websocket protocol is not automatically added anymore if the user specifies a protocol in `libp2p.modules`
  when using `Waku.create`.
- **Breaking**: Options passed to `Waku.create` used to be passed to `Libp2p.create`;
  Now, only the `libp2p` property is passed to `Libp2p.create`, allowing for a cleaner interface.
- Examples (cli chat): Use tcp protocol instead of websocket.

### Added

- Enable access to `WakuMessage.timestamp`.
- Examples (web chat): Use `WakuMessage.timestamp` as unique key for list items.
- Doc: Link to new [topic guidelines](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/23/) in README.
- Doc: Link to [Waku v2 Toy Chat specs](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/22/) in README.
- Examples (web chat): Persist nick.
- Support for custom PubSub Topics to `Waku`, `WakuRelay`, `WakuStore` and `WakuLightPush`;
  Passing a PubSub Topic is optional and still defaults to `/waku/2/default-waku/proto`;
  JS-Waku currently supports one, and only, PubSub topic per instance.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-05-21

### Added

- Implement [Waku v2 Light Push protocol](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/19/).
- Expose `Direction` enum from js-waku root (it was only accessible via the proto module).
- Examples (cli chat): Use light push to send messages if `--lightPush` is passed.
- Examples (cli chat): Print usage if `--help` is passed.

## [0.4.0] - 2021-05-18

### Added

- `callback` argument to `WakuStore.queryHistory()`, called as messages are retrieved
  ; Messages are retrieved using pagination, and it may take some time to retrieve all messages,
  with the `callback` function, messages are processed as soon as they are received.

### Changed

- Testing: Upgrade nim-waku node to v0.3.
- **Breaking**: Modify `WakuStore.queryHistory()` to accept one `Object` instead of multiple individual arguments.
- `getStatusFleetNodes` return prod nodes by default, instead of test nodes.
- Examples (web chat): Connect to prod fleet by default, test fleet for local development.
- Examples (cli chat): Connect to test fleet by default, use `--prod` to connect to prod fleet.

### Fixed

- Expose `Enviroment` and `Protocol` enums to pass to `getStatusFleetNodes`.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-05-15

### Added

- `getStatusFleetNodes` to connect to Status' nim-waku nodes.

### Changed

- Clarify content topic format in README.md.

## Removed

- Unused dependencies.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-14

### Added

- `WakuRelay.getPeers` method.
- Use `WakuRelay.getPeers` in web chat app example to disable send button.

### Changed

- Enable passing `string`s to `addPeerToAddressBook`.
- Use `addPeerToAddressBook` in examples and usage doc.
- Settle on `js-waku` name across the board.
- **Breaking**: `RelayDefaultTopic` renamed to `DefaultPubsubTopic`.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-05-12

### Added

- Add usage section to the README.
- Support of [Waku v2 Relay](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/11/).
- Support of [Waku v2 Store](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/13/).
- [Node Chat App example]().
- [ReactJS Chat App example](./examples/web-chat).
- [Typedoc Documentation](https://js-waku.wakuconnect.dev/).
