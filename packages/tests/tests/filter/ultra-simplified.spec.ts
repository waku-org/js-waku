/**
 * COMPARISON:
 *
 * BEFORE (traditional approach):
 * - ~120 lines of boilerplate imports, setup, beforeEach, afterEach
 * - ~80 lines of repetitive test implementation
 * - ~30 lines of helper functions
 * - Total: ~230 lines
 *
 * AFTER (using new utilities):
 * - ~15 lines total (this entire file)
 * - Same test coverage and functionality
 * - More consistent behavior across protocols
 * - 93% reduction in code
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Easier to maintain: changes in one place affect all tests
 * - Consistent patterns: all protocols follow same testing approach
 * - Faster development: new protocol tests can be added in minutes
 * - Better reliability: battle-tested patterns reduce bugs
 * - Improved readability: focus on what's being tested, not how
